I value a work environment that values professionalism and allows creativity and individuality. A work environment that allows personal and professional growth is key to me, specifically.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:

I've researched and been part of many industries for my age and gained quite the insight on how software development and web development can improve these industries and businesses as well.

Here is a list of industries I've been in:
    ~Retail - I was a seasonal employee at Footgear, and my roles were merchandising and sales

    ~ Transport - I was a driver for BuDDys, which is a company which transported people home after hours in their own vehicles after they had a night out.

    ~ Logistics - I was a courier for Lancet Laboratories for 4 months and then got promoted to Courier Co-ordinator where my role changed to overseeing the couriers and assigning them tasks as well as taking inbound calls to assist and recieve collection details from various doctors and medical facilities and then assigning couriers to these calls. A very high pressure environment.

What piqued my interest were the number of businesses and start-ups including medical practices which don't have websites or have outdated or poorly designed websites. Another thing that interest me was how simple web applications or software applications could drastically improve these industries if they integrate some automation into them.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
These industries have have taught me that no matter the field you in or the industry you are in, using software applications to improve productivity and workflow is a must but majority of them are still using outdated or very demanding software solutions which really aligned with me because I tend to think of easier or more simple ways to come up with solutions for problems that have arised or are reacurring.

Areas that need to be explored in the majority of businesses and industries, in my opinion, are automated solutions. This can be a big game changer, in my opinion, and it is something I will be looking into because businesses and specific industries can increase productivity and customer satisfaction by automating certain aspects within their systems. This is a gap which I think will gradually be filled shortly, and is very exciting for us as developers as well as businesses looking to improve.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Goals for the near future:
        ~ Complete qualification at CodeSpace. This is needed to obtain the basics for becoming a one-man website developer.

        ~ Create 2-3 websites for businesses. Once I've created these websites it will be used in my personal portfolio to showcase my skills and abilities in order to increase appeal to other businesses.

        ~ Create a personal portfolio. A personal portfolio is very important in promoting who you are and what you are capable of and can be used to showcase your designs as well as abilities to clients who are inerested.

        ~ Become a freelance developer targeting small business and start-ups. Once I've establisged myself and gained a few clients I would have reached my short term goal of becoming a freelance developer and would continue to put in the work to grow my portfolio and my clientele.
    
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
 My long-term aspirations would be to open up a software development firm that provides business solutions with a focus on automated systems. This aligns with my problem-solving mindset and drive to turn chaos into simplicity. The firm would not be specifically for high-end or major businesses. It would focus on providing web and software solutions to small businesses and start-ups to help the local economy thrive. I believe that in South Africa, the software/web development scene took a big leap in recent years and thus created a gap where we develop solutions to first-world problems while living in a third-world country. Thus, by targeting start-ups and small businesses, I'm looking to fill that gap. This aligns entirely with my interest and skills because by tackling and automating simple solutions for these businesses, I will be doing my part in helping a bigger problem regarding the growth of small businesses in our economy.


### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Continue to complete tasks and practice coding to complete the qualification at Codespace

    - Build a portfolio and include the 2-3 demo websites needed to showcase my skills and abilities. This will require hosting as well as multiple tools such as Figma and VS Code.

    - Create a price list and package deals for simple landing pages as well as multiple-page websites specifically designed for small businesses, and come up with a monthly subscription package deal for frequent updates and maintenance to websites. I will need to look at costs that might affect pricing, such as hosting if the client doesn't have a domain, as well as custom packages that clients might need due to specific requests.

    - Find clients through researching businesses and start-ups. This will be done using social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and even search engines such as Google and Google Maps.

    - Deliver my first job once a client is found by getting all the criteria needed according to their expectations and needs. In order to successfully deliver my first job will need multiple designs and determine how many pages they need. Build it and host it myself if they are not able or if they do not have a domain, and continuously get feedback from them and change any designs or formats they do not approve of.

    - I would then need to get feedback and testimonials from clients in order to promote my designs and websites, in order to update my personal portfolio, in order to get new clients and promote myself as well. Promoting myself would be done on social media sites such as LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, as well as sites such as Fiverr.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
 The main preparation for my long-term goals would be the work I would be doing as a freelance developer. Growing my portfolio would help tremendously in the long run due to the experience gained and the networking that will be done while gaining clients. Although that would be laying the groundwork, I would still need to learn a lot of new skills and languages. I would have to eventually dive deeper into more advanced JavaScript as well as due a few qualifications in business. I would also need to learn personal discipline as well as management skills because I would not be working alone, I would eventually need partners in the endeavour, and might need to hire a small team as well to handle specific projects. I would need to register as a business with the government for legal reasons, which also costs fees. Capital would be needed as well to start a business like this, thus, I will either need investors or gain capital through a business loan at a bank.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
 My biggest challenge regarding these goals of mine would be time. I will be pursuing this while being employed full-time. In order to work around this, I will be dedicating 2-4 hours on my off days to starting this and 1-2 hours either before or after work as well. This will also affect how fast I can grow regarding my academics because I would need to dedicate time to other qualifications as well. This would mean I will spend a great deal of my efforts on time management.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
 I have got major growth opportunities. I've created great relationships with multiple other developers whom I've studied with as well as worked with who could teach me, guide me, and assist me with anything code-related and design-related.

 I have also created great relationships with multiple business owners who are willing to hear me out and develop websites for them, and if not for them, then for some of their colleagues in their industries. This is very helpful because I know very successful business owners along the Garden Route, which could open the door for a lot more business and start-ups beyond Cape Town, which is where I reside. This creates the opportunity for me to gain investors as well if I do ever decide to take this full-time.
